Thrombosis can cause life-threatening disorders. Unfortunately, current therapeutic methods for thrombosis using injecting thrombolytic medicines systemically resulted in unexpected bleeding complications. Moreover, the absence of practical imaging tools for thrombi raised dangers of undertreatment and overtreatment. This study develops a theranostic drug carrier, Pkr(IR-Ca/Pda-uPA)-cRGD, that enables real-time monitoring of the targeted thrombolytic process of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Pkr(IR-Ca/Pda-uPA)-cRGD, which is prepared from a Pickering-emulsion-like system, encapsulates both near-infrared-II (NIR-II) contrast agent (IR-1048 dye, loading capacity: 28%) and urokinase plasminogen activators (uPAs, encapsulation efficiency: 89%), pioneering the loading of multiple drugs with contrasting hydrophilicity into one single-drug carrier. Upon intravenous injection, Pkr(IR-Ca/Pda-uPA)-cRGD considerably targets to thrombi selectively (targeting rate: 91%) and disintegrates in response to acidic thrombi to release IR-1048 dye and uPA for imaging and thrombolysis, respectively. Investigations indicate that Pkr(IR-Ca/Pda-uPA)-cRGD enabled real-time visualization of targeted thrombolysis using NIR-II imaging in DVT models, in which thrombi were eliminated (120 min after drug injection) without bleeding complications. This may be the first study using convenient NIR-II imaging for real-time visualization of targeted thrombolysis. It represents the precision medicine that enables rapid response to acquire instantaneous medical images and make necessary real-time adjustments to diagnostic and therapeutic protocols during treatment.
