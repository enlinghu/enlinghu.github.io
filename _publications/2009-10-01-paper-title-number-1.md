Bioadhesives are often used to stop bleeding and fix damaged tissue. However, the wound surface being too wet (from blood and/or wound exudate) makes bioadhesives not stick well, which makes it hard to keep caring for wounds. This study easily created a polyphenolic silk powder called Tan@SF-pwd-hydro that can soak up blood and fluids and then change into strong bioadhesives called Tan@SF-gel-hydro. This allows for better wet bonding for stopping bleeding and healing tissues. Tan@SF-pwd-hydro could protect wounds from getting wet and change right away into Tan@SF-gel-hydro to seal wounds and stop bleeding while they heal. In the groundbreaking study, the silk powders used wetness on wounds to make strong adhesion, artistically turning challenges into opportunities. The simple production method also opens up new ways to make biomaterials that are sustainable.
